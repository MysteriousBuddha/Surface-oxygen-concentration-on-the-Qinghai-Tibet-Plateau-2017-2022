Welcome to the GitHub page for the Surface oxygen concentration on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2017-2022), where we provide a script for constructing the oxygen concentration estimation model and estimating the oxygen concentration distribution data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

The script "Code.py" introduce how to construct the oxygen concentration estimation model and estimate the oxygen concentration distribution data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plaeau. The code is fully operational under Python 3.9.2, and the used packages are numpy, pandas, osgeo, tqdm and sklearn.

If you have any questions, please contact the author at the email address (xiaokangh@foxmail.com).
